Unidirectional flow can occur in these arteriovenous anastomoses and result in shunting of blood towards one twin and away from the other when the arteriovenous anastomoses are unbalanced.
DOID:14021,Tietze's syndrome,"A cartilage disease that is characterized by localized tenderness and non-suppurative swelling, typically associated with the 2nd or 3rd costal cartilages unilaterally caused by inflammation of one or more of the costal cartilages and that has symptom anterior chest pain."
DOID:14497,Wolman disease,"A lysosomal acid lipase deficiency characterized by infantile onset of rapidly progressive accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides throughout the body, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, severe malnutrition, jaundice, vomiting, diarrhea, steatorrhea. Death usually occurs within the first year of life."
DOID:14502,cholesterol ester storage disease,A lysosomal acid lipase deficiency characterized by onset in childhood or later of progressive accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides primarily in the liver and spleen.
DOID:1931,hypothalamic disease,A brain disease located_in the hypothalamus.
DOID:2361,macrocytic anemia,An anemia that is characterized by the production of abnormally large red blood cells and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (more than 100 fL).
DOID:3098,small cell sarcoma,A sarcoma characterized by the presence of small round or elongated malignant cells with a small amount of cytoplasm.

It may arise de novo or from a pre-existing lesion of the bone. Pain and a palpable mass are the most frequent clinical sign and symptom. It may spread to other anatomic sites, particularly the lungs."
DOID:3613,Canavan disease,"A leukodystrophy characterized by onset in early infancy, atonia of neck muscles, hypotonia, hyperextension of legs and flexion of arms, blindness, severe mental defect, megalocephaly, and death by 18 months on the average that has_material_basis_in homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in ASPA gene encoding aspartoacylase on chromosome 17p13."
DOID:4183,pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism,A pseudohypoparathyroidism characterized by a lack of resistance to parathyroid hormone or other hormones along with the constellation of clinical features referred to as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and that has_material_basis_in a mutation resulting in loss of function of the Gs-alpha isoform of the GNAS gene on the paternal allele. This results in expression of the Gs-alpha protein only from the maternal allele.
DOID:4184,pseudohypoparathyroidism,"A metal metabolism disorder that is characterized by end-organ resistance to parathyroid hormone and/or a constellation of symptoms collectively termed Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy, which include shortening and widening of long bones located_in the hand or located_in the foot along with short stature, obesity, and rounded face."
